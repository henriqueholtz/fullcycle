# EDA - Event Driven Architecture

- **Event notification**: Only a specific part of the data
- **Event Carried State Transfer**: The complete (or almost) data
- **Event sourcing**: Based as a timeline. You might run a replay of all events. (ex: bank account balance)
- **Event colaboration**: https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventCollaboration.html
